# This file provides the FORMAT you should use for the
# slopes in HP2.3. x denotes the horizontal distance
# travelled (by the truck) on a given slope, and
# alpha measures the slope angle at distance x
#
# iSlope denotes the slope index (i.e. 1,2,..10 for the
# training set etc.)
# iDataSet determines whether the slope under consideration
# belongs to the training set (data_set_index = 1), validation
# set (data_set_index = 2), or the test set (data_set_index = 3).
#
# Note that the slopes given below are just EXAMPLES.
# Please feel free to implement your own slopes below,
# as long as they fulfil the criteria given in HP2.3.
#
# You may remove the comments above and below, as they
# (or at least some of them) violate the coding standard 
#  a bit. :)
# The comments have been added as a clarification of the 
# problem that should be solved!).
